Whenever a string is constructed using a loop that iterates more than just a few times, it is usually better to create a StringBuffer or StringBuilder object and append to that. Because such buffers are based on mutable character arrays, which do not require a new string to be created for each concatenation, they can reduce the cost of repeatedly growing the string.

To choose between StringBuffer and StringBuilder, check if the new buffer object can possibly be accessed by several different threads while in use. If multi-thread safety is required, use a StringBuffer. For purely local string buffers, you can avoid the overhead of synchronization by using a StringBuilder.
