The author concludes the paper by rough out number of suggestions base on two main key points. The first claim is based on the particular methodologies that use projects. “Surprisingly, the most frequently used methodology was the waterfall model” -  Vijayasarathy & Butler (2016).  From the methodologies ranging from generic frameworks to more specialized processes often used framework is waterfall model. “Perhaps our most interesting finding was the prevalence of a hybrid approach to methodologies”- Vijayasarathy & Butler (2016). Some factors indicate a certain methodology as being appropriate, while the level of another part of the factors leads to the conclusion that another methodology is suitable. Then the solution is to combine parts of compatible methodologies and use them jointly to develop the software. “although no particular methodology was used in more than one-third of the projects, agile methodologies had high use- measurably higher than in 2003” - Vijayasarathy & Butler (2016). Even though many projects use a combination of different methodologies, agile methodologies more acceptable. Furthermore, Agile has slowly been more acceptable over the past years.  “The emergence of ‘agile ‘development methods (see chapter 6) is, in part a response to the difficulty of specifying software requirement ‘up front’ and recognition that a more evolutionary approach - where the suppliers and customers work closely together to refine their understanding of the need” - Cadle, J. & Yeates, D. (2008) Project Management for Information Systems (5th edition). London: Pearson/Prentice Hall]. “hybrid approaches frequently used agile methodologies.”- Vijayasarathy & Butler (2016). Hybrid approach regularly uses a combination of agile methods with other non-agile methods.
