PROJECT BASED LEARNING
In Project Based Learning (PBL), the teacher steps down from stage and in turn assigns projects to students. These projects usually encompass ideas that they will actually be dealing with in the real world. Projects can be done individually or in groups. In any case, this allows students to look for information they need themselves, instead of relying on the teacher for answers. If organized in groups, students get a chance to interact with their peers, pool in gathered information and come up with a working solution together, thus enhancing their social skills and teamwork through collaboration.  As a result, students not only get credit for their hard work, but also learn something in the process.
On a completely subjective note, PBL is more effective than any quiz that a teacher may give in the classroom.
